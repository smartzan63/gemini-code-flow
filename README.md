# Gemini Code Flow 🚀

> **Built on the amazing work by [RuV](https://github.com/ruvnet)** - this is an adaptation of [Claude Code Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-code-flow) for Gemini CLI

## 🙏 Credit

**This project exists because of [RuV's](https://github.com/ruvnet) incredible work on Claude Code Flow.** All the brilliant concepts, SPARC methodology, and multi-agent orchestration come from RuV's original project. I'm just a noob trying to adapt it for Gemini CLI!

👉 **Go check out the original:** https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-code-flow

## 🌟 Overview

Gemini Code Flow brings the powerful SPARC methodology and multi-agent orchestration capabilities to Google's Gemini CLI platform. This tool enables developers to leverage multiple AI agents working in parallel to write, test, and optimize code systematically.

Each agent is run as a separate **Gemini CLI** process inside its own `tmux` session, allowing the orchestrator to manage a swarm of workers concurrently.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Run up to 10 Gemini agents in parallel
- **17 SPARC Development Modes**: Specialized agents for every development need
- **Persistent Memory**: Share knowledge across agents and sessions
- **Multimodal Support**: Leverage Gemini's ability to process images, PDFs, and sketches
- **Large Context Window**: Utilize Gemini's 1M token context for complex codebases
- **Google Search Integration**: Ground responses with real-time information

## 🛠️ SPARC Development Modes

1. 🏗️ **Architect** - System design and architecture
2. 🧠 **Auto-Coder** - Clean, modular implementation
3. 🧪 **Tester (TDD)** - Test-driven development
4. 🪲 **Debugger** - Troubleshooting and bug fixes
5. 🛡️ **Security Reviewer** - Security audits
6. 📚 **Documentation Writer** - Comprehensive documentation
7. 🔗 **System Integrator** - Component integration
8. 📈 **Deployment Monitor** - Post-launch monitoring
9. 🧹 **Optimizer** - Performance optimization
10. ❓ **Ask** - Task formulation guide
11. 🚀 **DevOps** - Deployment and infrastructure
12. 📘 **SPARC Tutorial** - Interactive learning
13. 🔐 **Database Admin** - Database management
14. 📋 **Specification Writer** - Requirements and pseudocode
15. ♾️ **MCP Integration** - External service connections
16. ⚡️ **SPARC Orchestrator** - Complex workflows
17. 🎨 **Designer** - UI/UX with multimodal capabilities

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Gemini CLI installed globally
- `tmux` installed for parallel agent execution

```bash
# Install Gemini CLI first
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

# Install Gemini Code Flow (now available on npm!)
npm install -g gemini-code-flow
```

**✅ Package is now live on npm:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/gemini-code-flow

## 🔐 Authentication Options

Gemini Code Flow supports multiple authentication methods:

### Option 1: Personal Google Account (Recommended for Individual Use)
**Free usage with generous limits:**
- 60 requests per minute
- 1,000 requests per day
- Access to Gemini 2.5 Pro with 1M token context

```bash
# Simply login with your Google account when prompted
gemini-flow init --sparc
# No API key configuration needed!
```

### Option 2: API Key (For Professional/Enterprise Use)
For multiple simultaneous agents or usage-based billing:

```bash
# Set your API key from Google AI Studio or Vertex AI
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Current Limitations (Preview)
- Personal Google accounts: 60 requests/minute, 1,000/day
- Some advanced features may require API key authentication
- For the latest usage limits and capabilities, see [Google's official announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-cli-your-open-source-ai-agent/)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new project with SPARC
gemini-flow init --sparc

# Start the orchestrator (spawns Gemini CLI agents in tmux)
gemini-flow start

# Run a specific SPARC mode
gemini-flow sparc architect "Design a microservices architecture"

# Launch multi-agent workflow
gemini-flow sparc "Build a REST API with authentication"
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Simple Task
```bash
gemini-flow agent "Refactor this function to use async/await"
```

### Complex Multi-Agent Workflow
```bash
gemini-flow sparc orchestrator "Create a full-stack application with React frontend and Node.js backend, including tests and documentation"
```

### Multimodal Development
```bash
gemini-flow sparc designer "Convert this wireframe sketch to React components" --file ./wireframe.png
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.gemini-flow.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "maxAgents": 10,
  "memoryPath": "./gemini-memory.json",
  "authMethod": "google-account",
  "modes": {
    "architect": {
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "maxTokens": 8000
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `authMethod`: `"google-account"` (default) or `"api-key"`
- `apiKey`: Only needed if using `"api-key"` method
- `maxAgents`: Number of parallel agents (consider rate limits)
- `memoryPath`: Location for persistent memory storage
